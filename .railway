# SyncNode Production Configuration

This file contains production-specific settings for Railway deployment.

## Environment Variables Required
- All variables from .env.example must be set in Railway dashboard
- POLL_INTERVAL should be set to 120000 (2 minutes) for production
- NODE_ENV should be set to "production"
- LOG_LEVEL should be set to "info" 

## Railway Configuration
- Uses railway.json for deployment settings
- Automatically restarts on failure (max 3 retries)
- Uses npm run start:production as entry point

## Monitoring
- Logs are available in Railway dashboard
- Service runs continuously with polling strategy
- Memory usage should be monitored

## Cost Optimization
- Polling interval set to 2 minutes balances responsiveness with API usage
- Log level set to "info" reduces log volume
- Service automatically scales based on usage
